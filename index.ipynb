Pandasql is a library designed to make it easy to query DataFrames directly with SQL syntax, which was open-sourced by the company, Yhat, in late 2016.  It's very straightforward to use, but you are still encouraged to take a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/yhat/pandasql) as needed.  \n","\n","If you're using the pre-built virtual environment, you should already have the package ready to import.
